# cerebrate

Cerebrate is an [open-source platform](https://github.com/cerebrate-project) meant to act as a trusted contact information provider and interconnection orchestrator for other security tools (such as [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/)).

# Features

# Requirements and installation

The platform is built on CakePHP 4 along with Bootstrap 4 and shares parts of the code-base with [MISP](https://www.github.com/MISP).

The installation is documented at the following location [INSTALL/INSTALL.md](INSTALL/INSTALL.md). For upgrades, look at [INSTALL/UPGRADE.md](INSTALL/UPGRADE.md)

Hardware requirements:

A webserver with 4GB of memory and a single CPU core should be plenty for the current scope of Cerebrate. This might increase over the time with additional features being added, but the goal is to keep Cerebrate as lean as possible. Expect to have at least 40GB of disk space, depending on your log rotation strategy you might want to go higher.

For installation via docker, refer to the [cerebrate-docker](https://github.com/cerebrate-project/cerebrate-docker) repo.
